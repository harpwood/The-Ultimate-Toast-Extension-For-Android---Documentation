The “License”

Let’s do to both of us a favor by letting me not writing 100s of legal boring words and saving you time to read them. So, a synopsis of what you can and cannot do:

You can:
•	Include the extension into your project
•	You can use the extension to unlimited number of projects, as long as are YOUR projects
•	Your projects that will include the extension can be either commercial or not commercial.
•	You can modify or even extend the source code of the extension to better fit your needs

You cannot:
•	Distribute the extension. You are only allowed to use your copy. Please share the link of the extension instead -> https://harpwood.itch.io/the-ultimate-toast-extension-for-android
